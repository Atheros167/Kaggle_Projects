### Below are the list of Kaggle Competitions:

### 1. New York Taxi Trip Duration Prediction
* Details about the Competition [New York Taxi Trip](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration)
* In this competition, Kaggle challenge is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

### 2. Instacart Market Basket Analysis
* Details about the Competition [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
* Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or let whimsy guide your grazing, our unique food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you.
* Instacart’s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. Currently they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. Recently, Instacart open sourced this data - see their blog post on 3 Million Instacart Orders, Open Sourced.
* In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. [Code](https://github.com/Atheros167/Kaggle_Projects/blob/master/Instacart_latest.ipynb)

### 3. Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction
* Details about the competition [Porto Seguro](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction)
* Nothing ruins the thrill of buying a brand new car more quickly than seeing your new insurance bill. The sting’s even more painful when you know you’re a good driver. It doesn’t seem fair that you have to pay so much if you’ve been cautious on the road for years.
* Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, completely agrees. Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.
* In this competition, you’re challenged to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers [Code](https://github.com/Atheros167/Kaggle_Projects/blob/master/porto_seguro.ipynb)
